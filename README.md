# Digital Image Preprocessing

In image processing our aim is to enhance the image quality

### 1. Normalizing Image
- Convert pixel values from 0-255 to 0-1 range

### 2. Illumination Correction
- Various methods available, choose based on project requirements and previous research

### 3. Handling Noise

### 4. Duplicate Image Removal
- Check for exact and near-duplicate images

### 5. Image Quality Control
- Remove blurry images
- Remove images with unusual aspect ratios
- Resize images with odd dimensions
- Remove low-information images

# Downstream Computer Vision Tasks

### Non-Generative Tasks (Supervised CV)

1. [Object Localization / Image Classification + Localization Task](https://pub.towardsai.net/computer-vision-object-localization-task-2d536238510f)
2. [Object Detection / Recognition Task](https://pub.towardsai.net/computer-vision-object-detection-task-b572d58f2ada)
3. [Semantic Segmentation Task](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/semantic-segmentation-models-clearly-explained-780bde9515b5)
4. Instance Segmentation / Simultaneous Detection and Segmentation (SDS) Task
   - Advanced form of object detection with precise object outlines

### Generative Tasks (Unsupervised CV)

1. Style Transfer

2. Depth Estimation
   - Challenging task: understanding 3D structure from 2D images
   
   **Non-Learning Based Method:**
   - Stereo vision (outdated)
   - Requires two-camera setup (stereo pair)
   
   **Learning-Based Method:**
   - State-of-the-art approach
   - Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) using a single camera
   - Notable models:
     - MiDas Model (2019)
     - Depth Anything Model V1 (Early 2024)
     - Depth Anything Model V2 (Late 2024, SOTA)
