# Digital Image Preprocessing

In image processing our aim is to enhance the image quality

### 1. Normalizing Image
- Convert pixel values from 0-255 to 0-1 range

### 2. Illumination Correction
- Various methods available, choose based on project requirements and previous research

### 3. Handling Noise

### 4. Duplicate Image Removal
- Check for exact and near-duplicate images

### 5. Image Quality Control
- Remove blurry images
- Remove images with unusual aspect ratios
- Resize images with odd dimensions
- Remove low-information images











# Representation Learning / Tokenization

- Non-Modeling Based Methods
- Modeling Based Methods










# Downstream Computer Vision Tasks

### Non-Generative Tasks (Supervised CV)

1. Object Localization / Image Classification + Localization
2. Object Detection / Recognition
3. Semantic Segmentation
4. Instance Segmentation / Simultaneous Detection and Segmentation (SDS)
   - Advanced form of object detection with precise object outlines

### Generative Tasks (Unsupervised CV)

1. Style Transfer

2. Depth Estimation
   - Challenging task: understanding 3D structure from 2D images
   
   **Non-Learning Based Method:**
   - Stereo vision (outdated)
   - Requires two-camera setup (stereo pair)
   
   **Learning-Based Method:**
   - State-of-the-art approach
   - Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) using a single camera
   - Notable models:
     - MiDas Model (2019)
     - Depth Anything Model V1 (Early 2024)
     - Depth Anything Model V2 (Late 2024, SOTA)
