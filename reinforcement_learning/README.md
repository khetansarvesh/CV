Now above I have describing how to use RL with Neural Networks but earlier people did not use RL like this, earlier they used to extract some key features from the images and the use Markov Models to do things what is being done by Neural Networks here. Following are some must do courses to understand RL (do in the given sequence !! )

1. [Lectures from David Silver](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/) (Google Deepmind)
2. [John Schulman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtAIh9KSnjo) (OpenAI)
3. [Google Deepmind x UCL Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDVH599EItlEWsUOsJbAodm)
4. [CS 285](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHrlF10v2Og&list=PL_iWQOsE6TfURIIhCrlt-wj9ByIVpbfGc) from UC Berkley
5. [CS 234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgzM3zpZ55o&list=PLoROMvodv4rOSOPzutgyCTapiGlY2Nd8u) from Standford
6. [IIT Madras Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEAYkSg4uSQ0Hkv_1LHlJtC_wqwVu6RQX)
7. Multimodal RL from CMU
- [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI02F2XEe_0&list=PL-Fhd_vrvisNup9YQs_TdLW7DQz-lda0G&index=16)
- [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsAgvMC5fRs&list=PL-Fhd_vrvisNup9YQs_TdLW7DQz-lda0G&index=17)

Following are not courses but are good reads

- [Robot localization using Hidden Markov Models](https://dtransposed.github.io/blog/2018/04/01/Robot-Localization/)
- [RL with Unity 3D](https://dtransposed.github.io/blog/2019/03/10/GEAR/)
- [Understanding AlphaGo Zero](https://dtransposed.github.io/blog/2019/05/16/Alpha-Zero-1/)
